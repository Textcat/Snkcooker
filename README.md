# Snkcooker
Sneaker bot for shopify websites written in pure swift.

I open source this project because I developed the bot out of personal interest but I don't have much time to maintain it recently.The bot should work though I have never bought any product using it.

The usage is easy, just configure your shipping address, payment information, emails and then cop sneakers by link or keyword. You can check supported sites list inside the bot.
Captcha solver is ready to use, you can use my anticaptcha authkey to test those sites which require solving captcha.
